# A-Pathfinding-Visual
This is an attempt to visualize the A* Pathfinding Algorithm and use it to solve a Maze.

It first creates a Maze using the [Maze-Generation-Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm), then uses the [A* Pathfinding Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to find a way through the maze

## Running
One way to view the algorithm working, is visiting the link [https://divyanshuagarwal-23.github.io/A-Star-Pathfinding-Visual/](https://divyanshuagarwal-23.github.io/A-Star-Pathfinding-Visual/)

An Alternate Way can be to run it on the local server. Follow the instructions below to do so.
## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/divyanshuagarwal-23/A-Star-Pathfinding-Visual.git
cd A-Pathfinding-Visual
npm install -g http-server
```

## Running
In a new tab of terminal, opened in the A-Pathfinding-Visual folder, write the below command:
```
http-server
```
